## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript,

I began the project because I wanted more practice with JS 

## Optimizations

_(optional)_

You don't have to include this section but interviewers _love_ that you can not only deliver a final product that looks great but also functions efficiently. Did you write something then refactor it later and the result was 5x faster than the original implementation? Did you cache your assets? Things that you write in this section are **GREAT** to bring up in interviews and you can use this section as reference when studying for technical interviews!

## Lessons Learned:

This small yet powerful project has allowed me to continue my project based learning. I was able to practice the following: creating and updating variables, creating functions, using boolean conditions, creating conditionals, basic styling with CSS,
