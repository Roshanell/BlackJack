## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript,

I began the project because I wanted more practice with JS without having to follow tutorials and fall victim to tutorial hell. 


## Lessons Learned:

This small yet powerful project has allowed me to continue my project based learning. I was able to practice the following: arrays, objects, booleans, if else statements, comparison operators, logical operators, for loops, Math objects, and return statements.

## Examples:

Take a look at these couple examples that I have in my own portfolio:
